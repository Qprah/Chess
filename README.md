# Chess Game

## Description

This is a simple chess game implemented in Java using the StdDraw library. The game includes the core chess rules.

## Features

- All standard chess rules are implemented.
- The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with StdDraw.
  
## Known Issues

1. **Castling:** The castling move is not fully implemented. Currently, castling is not allowed, and the game doesn't check the necessary conditions for castling.

2. **Pawn Promotion:** When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, it is not automatically promoted. You should implement a feature that allows the player to choose a piece for promotion (typically a queen, but other options are valid).

## Usage

1. To run the game, compile and execute the `GameController.java` file.
2. Use the mouse to select and move pieces on the board.
3. Play against a friend or yourself.
